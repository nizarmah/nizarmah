I love open source and learning on the run.

I'm currently working as a platform backend engineer with Typescript.<br />
I'm also playing around with Go and building the ideas I need.

I'm learning to keep things simple again. I'm enjoying every bit of it.<br />
I'm also practicing being more intentional and consistent.
